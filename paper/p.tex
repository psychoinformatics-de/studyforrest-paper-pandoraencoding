\section*{Introduction}

In functional magnetic resonance imaging (f{MRI}) research, voxel-wise encoding
models are an increasingly popular tool to characterize the relationship
between a real world stimulus and BOLD activity patterns
\citep{NG11,TD+06,KG+08,SZ09}.  Yet not all encoding models are made alike, and
a researcher has many degrees of freedom in constructing one.  Parameters of
the data analysis, as well as parameters of BOLD-acquisition, like field
strength and resolution, might impact encoding performance \citep{KB07,FK12}.
Especially high-field f{MRI} (7-Tesla and higher), with its increased spatial
specificity \citep{THW+05,YU08}, could lead to better encoding models \citep{FK12}. 
\citet{SF14} offer some empirical evidence that an encoding model performs better on
7-Tesla than 3-Tesla data, although differing number of stimuli are a potential
confound. 

After collecting the data, more choices await -- how to preprocess, which
voxels to select and how to parameterize the encoding model -- and little is known about their
consequences. Even when we obtain an encoding model for each included voxel,
we can still choose between different ways of evaluating its performance.

Previous studies have introduced several measures for the quality of
an encoding model: \citet{ML08} used a binary retrieval task --- checking
whether an encoding model's predictions can be used to identify a stimulus from
a pair of stimuli --- to evaluate the predicted f{MRI} images for the meaning
of nouns. \citet{KG+08} used stimulus identification, and \citet{NG09} used
stimulus reconstruction, as a metric for encoding performance. In auditory
neuroscience, where encoding models are less frequent, only binary retrieval
accuracy \citep{CTK+2012} and stimulus identification \citep{SF14} have been
used. 

It remains an open question if these validation strategies are consistent
across different choices of analysis parameters and BOLD-acquisition schemes.

Recently, a 3-Tesla f{MRI} study on the perception of musical genres
\citep{CTK+2012} has been replicated with 7-Tesla data \citep{HDH+2015}, making
it possible to directly compare the effect of field strength on data analysis
parameters and validation strategies for encoding models. In this study, we
apply three different approaches to encoding validation --- binary retrieval
accuracy \citep{ML08}, stimulus identification \citep{KG+08,SF14} and the
decoding accuracy of a stimulus's music genre, and compare them in a 3-Tesla
and 7-Tesla dataset with identical stimuli and comparable design for different
analysis strategies.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Stimuli}

Stimuli were five natural, stereo, high-quality music stimuli (\unit[6]{s}
duration; \unit[44.1]{kHz} sampling rate) for each of five different musical
genres: 1) Ambient, 2) Roots Country 3) Heavy Metal, 4) 50s Rock'n'Roll, and 5)
Symphonic. Previously, all 25 stimuli and have been made publicly available
\citep{HDH+2015}.

\subsection*{fMRI data}

The analyses presented here were performed on two independently recorded, and
previously published datasets \citep{CTK+2012,HDH+2015} . While these datasets
have been acquired using identical stimuli, with the same number of acquisition
runs and number of stimulation trials, they nevertheless differ in their
precise stimulation timing, stimulation setup and equipment, as well as other
acquisition details. A brief description of both datasets is provided below.
For more information the reader is referred to the respective publications.

\paragraph{\unit[3]{Tesla}}
%
Participants were scanned in a Philips Intera Achieva scanner with 32 channel
SENSE head coil at the Dartmouth College. Functional scans were acquired with
an echo planar imaging sequence (\unit[2]{s} TR; \unit[35]{ms} TR,
\unit[90]{\textdegree} flip angle) with \unit[3]{mm} isotropic voxels.
% MIH: as it was published before we probably don't have to include this
%All subjects consented in accordance with the procedures set by the Committee
%for the Protection of Human Subjects at the Dartmouth College. 

Each subject participated in eight functional runs. Stimuli were presented in
an event-related design with a variable trial duration. Each run consisted of a
total of 29 trials corresponding to 25 music clips and 4 catch trials presented
randomly during each run. Each trial started with a \unit[6]{s} of music clip
followed by \unit[4-8]{s} of fixation. For catch trials, a question appeared
after the audio presentation asking whether a particular feature is present in
the music clip such as vocals, guitar, etc. Subjects responded “Yes” or “No”
with a button box. Catch trials helped keep the subjects’ attention to the
music and were discarded from the analyses. Each run had \unit[4]{s} of
fixation at the beginning and \unit[10]{s} of fixation at the end. For further
details, see \citet{CTK+2012}

\paragraph{\sevenT}
%
The procedures for the \unit[7]{Tesla} acquisition were highly similar and only
criticial differences are reported here. Echo-planar BOLD images
(gradient-echo, \unit[2]{s} repetition time (TR), \unit[22]{ms} echo time,
\unit[0.78]{ms} echo spacing, GRAPPA acceleration factor 3) were acquired using
a whole-body \sevenT\ Siemens MAGNETOM magnetic resonance scanner equipped with
a 32 channel brain receive coil. 36 axial slices (thickness \unit[1.4]{mm},
\unit[1.4 $\times$ 1.4]{mm} in-plane resolution) with a 10\% inter-slice gap
were recorded in ascending order.  Slices were oriented to include the ventral
portions of frontal and occipital cortex while minimizing intersection with the
eyeballs. The field-of-view was centred on the approximate location of Heschl's
gyrus.

Instead of dedicated catch trials, similar catch questions as for the 3T
acquisition were presented \unit[4]{s} after the end of the stimulus in trials
with an \unit[8]{s} inter-stimulus delay. Consequently, each run consisted of
25 trials, and no trials were discarded from the analysis.  There was no
additional fixation at the start of a run. For further details, see
\citet{HDH+2015}, and \citet{HBI+14} for details on MRI acquisition methods.


\subsection*{Preprocessing}

Approximate temporal lobe masks for each participant were extracted from
Montreal Neurological Institute coordinate space using FSL
\citep{SJB+04,JBB+12}, and projected into the subject-specific coordinate
system.  Each voxel inside the temporal lobe mask was run-wise $Z$-scored and
linearly de-trended using PyMVPA \citep{HHS09b}. 

\subsection*{Encoding model}

To build an encoding model with high predictive power, we need to find an
appropriate feature representation of the music stimuli.  \citet{CTK+2012}
already compared different feature representations of the same stimuli in the
3-Tesla dataset. They found features corresponding to the timbre of the
stimulus
% MIH: we haven't introduced this metric yet
%showed the highest binary retrieval accuracy.
offer the best discriminative power.  We chose a similar feature set made
available by \citet{HDH+2015}, the low-quefrency mel-frequency spectrum
(LQ-MFS) of the stimulus.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pics/encoding_scheme}

  \caption{A schematic overview of the encoding process. The spectrogram for
    each stimulus is transformed into its low-quefrency mel-frequency spectrum
    (LQ-MFS). Then, the encoding features are extracted by a sliding window
    from the LQ-MFS. Using these features, encoding model is trained on all
    runs in the training set, and used to predict the BOLD activity of the
  left-out run.  These predictions are subsequently used for validation.}

 \label{fig:encoding_scheme}
\end{figure}


For each f{MRI} sample $y_{vt}$ (where $t=1,2,..,T$ denotes the time-points and
$v=1,2,..,V$ denotes the voxels) the LQ-MFS features $x_{t}$
$[1\times\widetilde{M}]$ (where $\widetilde{M}$ is the number of LQ-MFS
coefficients) of the corresponding two second part of the stimulus were
computed. In case there was no stimulus presented at time-point $t$, a zero
vector $[1\times\widetilde{M}]$ was used. 

As the BOLD response is delayed,  the most recent feature vector was removed
for each f{MRI} sample (corresponds to an assumed \unit[2]{s} stimulus-response
delay), and the new feature vector at time-point $t$ was created by
concatenating the prior feature vectors $x_{t-1}$,$x_{t-2}$ and $x_{t-3}$ (see
Figure \ref{fig:encoding_scheme}). From now on, we denote this stacked feature
vector as $x_{t}$.  Feature vectors (and the corresponding f{MRI} sample) were
removed from the analysis, if two-thirds or more of the concatenated feature
vectors were zero-vectors.

The BOLD activity time-series, as well as the feature time-series, were
vertically stacked, resulting in a matrix of features $X$ $[N\times M]$ (where
$N$ is the number of f{MRI} samples, and $M$ is number of LQ-MFS coefficients,
with $M=3\widetilde{M}$) and a matrix of BOLD activity $Y$ $[N\times V]$ (where
$V$ is the number of voxels).

This lagging of the stimulus allows us to train the encoding model to predict
the f{MRI} time-series without explicitly modelling the BOLD response.

%probabilistic or objective function minimization, also cite someone about
%using lin. reg. in encoding
The encoding model could then be expressed as the probability to observe the
BOLD activity at time-point $t$ and voxel $v$:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:encmo}
  p(y_{vt}|x_{t}) = N(y_{vt};x_{t}\beta_{v},\sigma)
\end{equation}
%
where $N(y;\mu,\sigma)$ denotes the probability density at point $y$ for a
Gaussian with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, and $\beta_{v}$ is a
$[M\times1]$ vector of regression coefficients specific to voxel $v$. To reduce
over-fitting, the regression-coefficients were estimated using ridge regression
\citep{HK70}.  Independently for each voxel, the regularization parameter
$\lambda$ with the lowest mean squared error in a generalized leave-one-out
cross-validation \citep{GHW79} was chosen from a set of candidate values.

\subsection*{Quality metrics} 

\subsubsection*{Binary retrieval accuracy}

Binary retrieval accuracy \citep{ML08} tests if an encoding model's predictions
can differentiate a stimulus' observed BOLD activity from the BOLD activity of
a decoy stimulus.  Specifically, a stimulus pair is counted as succesfully
classified, if the cosine similarity between predicted and observed f{MRI}
responses is greater for the correctly matched predictions and observations
than for the incorrectly matched ones (i.e. the similarity of the observed
response of stimulus A with the predictions for stimulus B and vice versa).
The correct matches for all pair-wise combinations of stimuli, including
stimuli from the same genre, are counted and then divided by the number of
combinations.

\subsubsection*{Matching score}
%
An alternative measure of encoding performance is the correlation rank score or
matching score \citep{SF14}. For each stimulus label $l_{n}$ in the validation
set, its predicted BOLD activity $\widetilde{y}_{n}$ is correlated with the
observed BOLD activity of every stimulus, $y_{i}$ for $i=1..25$. These
correlations are then ordered, and the  matching score $m(l_{n})$ is \[
m(l_{n}) = 1-\frac{rank(l_{n})-1}{N-1} \] Where $rank(l_{n})$ is the rank of
the correlation between predicted $\widetilde{y}_{n}$ and observed $y_{n}$ BOLD
activity of $l_{n}$. Finally, the matching scores for all stimuli in the
validation set are averaged.



\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=9cm]{pics/Decoding_scheme}

  \caption{A schematic overview of the decoding of music category. The
    predicted f{MRI} time series of the validation run is reduced in
    dimensionality by principal component analysis, and a multivariate-normal
    likelihood function $p(y_{t}|x_{t})$ is constructed.  From there, the
  probability distribution over music stimuli and subsequently musical
categories is estimated.}

 \label{fig:decoding_scheme}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Decoding of stimulus category}

Instead of testing the encoding performance, we can also test the performance
of a decoder based on the individual encoding models \citep{NG11} (Figure
\ref{fig:decoding_scheme}).


To go from the probability of a voxel activation
given stimulus features $p(y_{vt}|x_{t})$ to probability of stimulus features
given voxel activation $p(x_{t}|y_{t})$ we follow \citet{NG09} and separate our
decoding scheme into two parts. 

\paragraph{Single- to Multi-Voxel Encoding}

First we condense the large number of voxel-specific encoding models into one
multi-voxel encoding model.  To do this we project the predicted and observed
f{MRI} data onto the first $k$ principal components of the $[N\times V]$ matrix
of predicted BOLD activity, where $k$ is the number of principal components
that maximize the decoding accuracy on the training set for this participant.
As in \citet{NG09} we construct the $k$-dimensional multivariate normal
probability density function $p(y_{t}|x_{t})$ to obtain a likelihood function
across voxels. 

\paragraph{Multi-Voxel Encoding to Decoding}

We now express this likelihood in terms of the label of the music stimulus, instead of its LQ-MFS features.  We
use the simplifying assumption that the BOLD activity is influenced by the
music stimuli only through their LQ-MFS coefficients $x$, and --- given that
each music stimulus was associated with only three (lagged) LQ-MFS
representations --- the likelihood to observe a given triple of consecutive $y$
for a specific music stimulus $l_{i}$ is $p(y|l_{i}) \propto
p(y_{t-1}|x_{1})p(y_{t}|x_{2})p(y_{t+1}|x_{3})$ where $t$ is the sample 6
seconds after the start of the music stimulus and $x$ are the three LQ-MFS
feature vectors of this stimulus.  For a given triple of consecutive BOLD
activity $y$ from the same stimulus, we can now estimate the probability
distribution over music stimuli $p(l_{i}|y)$ (for $i=1..25$) by using Bayes'
rule: $p(l_{i}|y) \propto p(y|l_{i})p(l_{i})$ and ignoring the normalizing
constant $p(y)$. Since each stimulus was presented was presented exactly once,
it has an uniform prior distribution with $p(l_{i})=\frac{1}{25}$. The mode of
this distribution is the most probable presented stimulus given the data.  We
can then decode the musical genre of the presented stimulus given the observed
BOLD activity as the mode of $p(c_{i}|y) \propto \prod\nolimits_{l \in
  stim(c_{i})} p(l|y)$ where $stim(c_{i})$ are the labels of the stimuli
  belonging to the genre $c_{i}$. 

\subsection*{Voxel selection}

We varied the number of voxels used in the analysis, both for 3- and 7-Tesla
f{MRI} data, and selected which voxels to keep by two different criteria. Both
criteria were based on voxel characteristics in the training set only.

\paragraph{Selection by stability}

\citet{ML08} selected the 500 most stable voxels for their analysis. For a
single voxel, each run can be represented as a vector of BOLD activity, where
each entry is associated with one stimulus. A voxel's "stability score" is then
the average (pair-wise) correlation between the vectors of the eight runs for
all combinations of runs.  This criterion selects voxels with consistent
activation for each stimulus across runs.

\paragraph{Selection by $r^2$}

As we are interested in encoding performance, we can use the quality of
predictions of each voxel's encoding model as a selection criterion. We compute
the coefficient of determination $r^2$ for each voxel-specific encoding model
in the training set. Using this criterion selects voxels whose activity can be
explained best by an LQ-MFS-based encoding model.

\section*{Results}

We varied the number of voxels used in the analysis and how they were selected,
both for 3- and 7-Tesla f{MRI} data, and compared the resulting differences in
three encoding metrics. To differentiate between effects of voxel number and
overall volume of the voxels, which differs in 3- and 7-Tesla, we show the
results as a function of the number of voxels, as well as overall volume of
these voxels.

  for each of the 19 participants. \textbf{B} Mean binary retrieval accuracy as

 \label{fig:binary_retrieval}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Binary retrieval accuracy}

Differences in binary retrieval accuracy are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:binary_retrieval}. For both selection criteria, binary retrieval
accuracy is higher in 3-Tesla than 7-Tesla data for lower numbers of voxels.
When a higher number of the most stable voxels are included, binary retrieval
accuracy increases for 7-Tesla data, while decreasing for 3-Tesla data.    In
contrast, increasing the number of voxels included by $r^2$ decreases the
binary retrieval accuracy for 3-Tesla, as well as 7-Tesla data, although the
decrease seen in 3-Tesla data is larger. The peak performance of 3-Tesla as
well as 7-Tesla encoding models, is higher using voxels selected by their
$r^2$.  Indexing by the overall volume of the voxels, reveals a very similar,
but shifted, pattern for 3- and 7-Tesla data.

 \label{fig:matching_score}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Matching score}

In Figure \ref{fig:matching_score}, the matching score is shown. Again, for few
voxels, encoding models for 3-Tesla data produce a higher score than encoding
models for 7-Tesla data. Increasing the number of voxels increases the matching
score for 7-Tesla data, and decreases the score for 3-Tesla data. This pattern
is present in both selection criteria. For voxels selected by $r^2$, there is a
steeper increase and decrease and a higher peak for both field strengths.  If
indexed by the overall voxel volume, similarities in the overlapping regions of
the 3- and 7-Tesla matching score curves can be seen.

 \label{fig:decoding_accuracy}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{Decoding accuracy}

The decoding accuracy of each stimulus's music category is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:decoding_accuracy}. As the decoder is based on an encoding model, a
natural comparison is with the performance of a standard decoder. For both
selection methods, we contrast the decoding performance of the encoding model
with the decoding performance of a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
\citep{FCH+08,V13}. While such a decoder can use the subset of the most stable
voxels, it can only select the voxels with the highest $r^2$, if it leverages
the information of an encoding model. We still include these data, to show
which information could be extracted from these voxels by a more sophisticated
decoding approach.  The decoding accuracy was higher for 7-Tesla data than for
3-Tesla data, across all voxel numbers and selection criteria.  Selecting the
most stable voxels, the decoding accuracy slightly increases for 7-Tesla data
with higher numbers of voxels, while decreasing for 3-Tesla data.  If we select
the voxel-specific encoding models with the highest $r^2$, the decoding
accuracy decreases for 3-Tesla data, but first stays level and then decreases
for 7-Tesla data. Encoding models on 3-Tesla data show a higher or equal
decoding accuracy than a discriminative decoder across all numbers of voxels.
This contrasts the pattern present in the 7-Tesla data, where our decoding
model shows a higher decoding accuracy only for smaller numbers of voxels.
%Using voxels selected by $r^2$ the Support Vector Machine starts to
%outperform the encoding model for lower numbers of voxels.

\subsection*{Effect of Multi-Voxel Encoding}

Field strength affects performance differentially in the binary
retrieval/matching score and the decoding accuracy. As our decoding scheme had
two parts -- reducing the independent voxel-wise encoding models to a single
encoding model (1) and computing the posterior probability of a stimulus given
the observed f{MRI} data (2) -- we cannot claim what causes this difference.

Therefore, we estimated the binary retrieval accuracy
\ref{fig:binary_retrieval_mve} and the matching score
\ref{fig:matching_score_mve} using the same reduced encoding model as in the
decoding accuracy.

\section*{Discussion}

Our results show considerable variation of different quality metrics with
parameters of the data analysis and BOLD-acquisition. We demonstrate that the
patterns of this variation differ between validation strategies and that the
effects of field strength, voxel selection, and voxel number are inconsistent
across these metrics.

Specifically, we show a similar performance in purely encoding based metrics
for 3- and 7-Tesla data with a slightly worse peak performance for 7-Tesla, but
observe that this effect is mediated by the number of voxels used. A previous
study \citep{SF14} found a higher performance for 7-Tesla data for the matching
score, although using a different number of stimuli in the 3- and 7-Tesla
datasets. %Furthermore, this study differs in the selection of voxels, the
%choice of stimulus features and the use
%of an explicit BOLD-model instead of a lagged feature representation.

One possible reason why we see a worse peak performance in these metrics for
higher field strength, might be the increased susceptibility to head-motion
artifacts and physiological noise in a single voxel. \citet{KB07} argue that
challenges posed by high-resolution f{MRI} might be tackled more easily by an
information-based approach, instead of an activation-based one, partly because
neural information can be locally combined without averaging. Since voxels are
treated independently in a voxel-wise encoding model, this advantage is lost if
voxel-specific information is not combined later on. In fact, if we reduce the
multi-voxel encoding model to a single joint encoding model
(\citep[see][]{NG09}), we observe a different pattern for field strength: the
obtained decoding accuracy is consistently higher in the 7-Tesla than the
3-Tesla dataset.  This reduction does only use information captured by the
encoding models, it is estimated from the predictions for a set of voxels, not
from the neuronal response itself, but this combination of voxel-specific
information is still sufficient to make a higher field strength advantageous. 


The number of voxels affect the encoding performance differentially for low and
high field strength. This is not surprising, voxel size differs for the 3- and
7-Tesla data. Indexing by the overall volume of the selected voxels, instead of
their number, reveals similarities in performance when 3- and 7-Tesla encoding
models are trained on a similar volume. 

Selecting the voxels by $r^2$ instead of a stability criterion, improves
performance especially in the lower number of voxels for the binary retrieval
accuracy and the decoding accuracy, while widening the performance gap between
3- and 7-Tesla data in the matching score. Including voxels ordered by $r^2$
--- a measure that captures encoding performance in a single voxel --- gives
diminishing returns for higher numbers of voxels: Voxels for which an encoding
model performs well are already included, and each additional voxel decreases
the joint encoding performance.  Interestingly, this pattern is not seen in the
matching score, where performance in 7-Tesla is worse for the smallest number
of voxels and increases with voxel number. The same pattern is seen in the
performance of the linear SVM. Even with information from an encoding model ---
selecting voxels by $r^2$ --- a standard decoder can initially not take
advantage of this information as well as an encoding model. For the high field
strength condition, the decoder improves if more voxels are included and
eventually performs better than the encoding model. This might be an effect of
the sheer number of features used by the decoder, or of the information content
of these voxels, i.e. because the decoder profits from pattern information that
is not related to the LQ-MFS features of the stimulus, and would therefore be
more present in a voxel with lower $r^2$ in encoding LQ-MFS.
