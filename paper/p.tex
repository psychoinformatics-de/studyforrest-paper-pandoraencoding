\section*{Introduction}

\cite{CTK+2012}

\todo[inline]{any fieldstrength differences, i.e. higher resolution gives better model?}
\todo[inline]{formisano says 7T better, but more stimuli and more data with a different model are confounds}
\todo[inline]{unclear which quality metric is most appropriate due to lack of literature}
\todo[inline]{maybe add other feature sets and check metrics across all of them}

% summary: first comparative study

\todo[inline]{is this the first decode(encode(fmri)) study?}

\section*{Methods}

\cite{HBI+14,HDH+2015}

\subsection*{fMRI data}

\paragraph{\unit[3]{Tesla}}
\paragraph{\unit[7]{Tesla}}

\subsection*{Encoding model}

\todo[inline]{reference feature set description and describe encoding algorithm}

\missingfigure{encoding scheme}

\subsection*{Quality metrics}

\paragraph{Binary retrieval accuracy}

\todo[inline]{cite both mitchel and casey}

\paragraph{Correlation rank metric}

\todo[inline]{cite formisano}

\paragraph{Decoding accuracy}

%test decoding with the first PCA components of the encoded signal removed
%-->reduced accuracy by ~10%

\section*{Results}

	
%estimate size of model input (mitchel had 500, no idea why); check for 7T and 3T)
\todo[inline]{update for different nr of voxels & 3T}

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pics/voxelnr}
	\caption{Correlation rank score as a function of the included number of voxels. The included voxels were the most stable ones i.e. their activity corresponding to each stimulus had the highest mean pairwise correlation across runs.}
	\label{fig:voxelnr}
\end{figure}
 
 
 
%binary classification accuracy result, connect to casey/mitchel
\todo[inline]{potentially other nr of voxels, take avr across all runs for 3T and 7T}

%correlation rankscore 3 and 7 incl. permutation analysis
\todo[inline]{potentially other nr of voxels, take avr across all runs for 3T and 7T,add permutation analysis}

%decoding(encoding) accuracy: 3 vs 7 (vs. plain decoding)
\todo[inline]{potentially other nr of voxels, take avr across all runs for 3T and 7T,add discriminative classifier baseline}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pics/decoding_accuracy}

\section*{Discussion}

\todo[inline]{7T doesnt matter -- stay cheap}

\todo[inline]{decode(encode(fmri)) vs. plain decoding}

\todo[inline]{naturalistic validation is now mandatory}
