\cite{CTK+2012}

\todo[inline]{any fieldstrength differences, i.e. higher resolution gives better model?}
\todo[inline]{formisano says 7T better, but more stimuli and more data with a different model are confounds}
\todo[inline]{unclear which quality metric is most appropriate due to lack of literature}
\todo[inline]{maybe add other feature sets and check metrics across all of them}

% summary: first comparative study

\todo[inline]{is this the first decode(encode(fmri)) study?}

%each voxel separately, ridge, generalized cross-validation -- look up possible citations

For each f{MRI} sample $y_{vt}$ (where $t=1,2,..,T$ denotes the time-points and $v=1,2,..,V$ denotes the voxels) the LQ-MFS features $x_{t}$ $[1x\widetilde{M}]$ (where $\widetilde{M}$ is the number of LQ-MFS coefficients) of the corresponding two second part of the stimulus was computed. In case there was no stimulus presented at time-point $t$, it was associated with a $[1x\widetilde{M}]$ zero-vector. 


Since the BOLD response is delayed, for each f{MRI} sample, the previous features were temporally stacked and the most recent feature vector removed (since it could not yet have influenced the f{MRI} activity), therefore creating a new feature vector for each time-point $t$ by concatenating $x_{t-1}$,$x_{t-2}$ and $x_{t-3}$.  

The f{MRI} activity time-series, as well as the feature time-series, were then vertically stacked, resulting in a matrix of features $X$ $[NxM]$ (where $N$ is the number of f{MRI} samples, and $M$ is number of LQ-MFS coefficients, with $M=3\widetilde{M}$) and a matrix of f{MRI} activity $Y$ $[NxV]$ (where V is the number of voxels).

%here linear model + ridge etc.

\subsection*{Quality metrics}

\todo[inline]{add description of standardization}

\paragraph{Binary retrieval accuracy}

Binary retrieval accuracy \cite{ML08} was used in a prior study \cite{CTK+2012}, which also employed massively univariate encoding models on the same dataset.

For a trained model $\mathbf{C}$ $[M x V]$ (where M is the number of LQ-MFS coefficients and V is the number of voxels), and a given LQ-MFS representation of two stimuli from the validation set $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ $[1 x M]$ and their corresponding f{MRI} activity $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ $[ 1 x V ]$, the binary retrieval accuracy is computed as follows:

-Using the univariate encoding models for each voxel, compute the predicted f{MRI} activity given $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:predict}
\widetilde{i}_{1} = s_{1}C
\end{equation}
-Compute the cosine similarity, the cosine of the angle between two vectors, for each combination of $\widetilde{i}$ and $i$, i.e.
\[ cossim(\widetilde{i}_{1},i_{1}) =  \frac{\widetilde{i}_{1} \cdot i_{1}}{\|\widetilde{i}_{1} \cdot i_{1}\|} \] 
-If \[ cossim(\widetilde{i}_{1},i_{1})+cossim(\widetilde{i}_{2},i_{2}) < cossim(\widetilde{i}_{1},i_{2})+cossim(\widetilde{i}_{2},i_{1}) \] the binary retrieval was successfull for this pair of stimuli
-The mean binary retrieval accuracy in the validation set is computed on the binary retrieval successes for each combination of stimuli

\paragraph{Correlation rank metric}
\todo[inline]{check if it was really introduced by santoro et al.}
An alternative measure of encoding performance is the correlation rank score introduced by Santoro et al. (\cite{SF14}). For each stimulus $s_{n}$ $n=1,2..N$  in the validation set its predicted f{MRI} activity $\widetilde{i}_{n}$ is computed as in \ref{eq:predict}.
For a given stimulus, the correlations between its predicted f{MRI} activity $\widetilde{i}_{n}$ and the measured f{MRI} activity of all stimuli were computed, and the matching score $m(s_{n})$ is computed as
\[ m(s_{n}) = 1-\frac{rank(s_{n})-1}{N-1} \]
Where $rank(s_{n})$ is the rank of the correlation between $\widetilde{i}_{n}$ and $i_{n}$.

\paragraph{Decoding accuracy}

%test decoding with the first PCA components of the encoded signal removed
%-->reduced accuracy by ~10%
